# 100

Hey, I used this repo to learn SwiftUI by [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui). Although in my case it took more than 365 days with a big gap in between :)

Nevertheless, I've gained a lot from the course and it helped me to build a production-ready app. The course is well-structured, balanced, has a lot of insights, covers major SwiftUI features alongside Core Graphics, Core Image, MapKit, and more. Most important thing is that the course heavily relies on project-based learning, including challenges and milestone projects. I want to express my gratitude to [@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws/) not only for this course but for a huge impact on the iOS development world.

For anyone who is planning to start, I wish you perseverance and the best of luck ðŸš€

P.S This repo should not be used elsewhere as it was not intended to do so. You can face much ambiguity and ugly code ;)
